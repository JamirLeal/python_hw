# Optimization Algos

**This repo contains some implementations of optimization techniques used to solve classic problems. All the implementations are in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.**

## Structure of the Repo

### 1. Blind Optimization

Minimizing [Ackley function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackley_function) using blind optimization technique.

### 2. Simulated Annealing

Solving the Traveller Salesman Problem using [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) (uses markov chain).

### 3. Particle Swarm Optimization

Again, minimizing [Ackley function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackley_function) with [Particle Swarm Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization).

### 4. Genetic Algorithm

Solving the classic [Knapsack Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) with the help of [Genetic Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm). There are two datasets that contains weights and profits respectively.

### 5. Genetic Programming

Using a evolutionary computation library [(DEAP)](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to solve some input-output relation problem.

### 6. Fuzzy control

Given a basic physics funtion to get final position from an initial speed a [fuzzy controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_control_system) was implemented using [skfuzzy](https://pythonhosted.org/scikit-fuzzy/) library.
